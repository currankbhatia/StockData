# StockData
Market Analysis Tools

Using yahoo-finance python helper package that is not added in the code.

There are many trading analysis technologies already out there.
The goal of this project is to spit out stocks that are likely to succeed, 
and give numbers and statistics that back this.

We are creating:

Plotting Tools: 
In order to debug our own work, and when understanding why a stock should 
be bought or sold, a plot will give us useful information.

Industry Sector Watchers:
Uses data from Industry and overall stock market to predict whether or not 
a stock should be bought and what itâ€™s chances are of being successful.


Changes we will have to implement for further robustness:

> Change from Yahoo Finance to a more robust Dataset
> Build a Web Service to house all data and build a nicer looking tool
